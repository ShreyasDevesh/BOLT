In today's linked world, overcoming linguistic boundaries is critical for creating cooperation, understanding, and advancement. However, the multiplicity of languages is a tremendous barrier, frequently resulting in misinterpretations, inefficiencies, and misunderstandings. 
Current language translation methods, while beneficial, sometimes lack accuracy and subtlety, resulting in ineffective communication and probable mistakes. Ancient texts from India have a history of misinterpretation resulting in prevailing issues such as the caste system and clashes of minds and racesowing to the same problem.
